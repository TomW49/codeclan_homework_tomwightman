---**Question 1**

Read in all 4 credit card transaction datasets and clean column names.
```{r}
card_base         <- read_csv("data/CardBase.csv") %>% 
                     janitor::clean_names()
  
cust_base         <- read_csv("data/CustomerBase.csv") %>% 
                     janitor::clean_names()

fraud_base        <- read_csv("data/FraudBase.csv") %>% 
                     janitor::clean_names()

transaction_base  <- read_csv("data/TransactionBase.csv") %>% 
                     janitor::clean_names()
```


---**Question 2**

Join the data containing card details and customer details by customer id, so that all records of card details and any matching records in customer details are kept. Before you run the code, think about how many rows you expect to see after joining.

```{r}
card_base        
cust_base        

inner_join(cust_base, card_base, by = "cust_id")
```

I expect to see 500 rows as that is the amount of card details held, else there would be 5174 NA's

---**Question 3**

Join the data containing fraud details with transaction details so all rows of both tables are kept. What does the resulting row number tell you?

```{r}
fraud_base
transaction_base

full_join(transaction_base, fraud_base, by = "transaction_id")
```
Row number tells me there are only 109 fraud cases linked to held transaction details, check with na's

---**Question 4**

Join the data containing card details with transaction details so rows from the first which have matching ones in the second are returned, but only return rows in the first table once.

```{r}
card_base
transaction_base

semi_join(card_base, transaction_base, by = c("card_number" = "credit_card_id"))
```


## `tidyr`

---**Question 5**

Read in `hat_observations` and separate `observation` into two columns, `hat_colour` and `hat_type`.

```{r}
hat_obs <- read_csv("data/hat_observations.csv") %>% 
  separate(observation, c("hat_colour", "hat_type"))
hat_obs
```


---**Question 6**

Unite `day`, `month`, and `year` columns into a column called `date` using a suitable separator. Then find the date where the most berets were observed.

```{r}
hat_obs%>% 
  unite(date, 
        c(day, month, year), 
        sep = "/") %>% 
  filter(hat_type == "beret") %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(observation_count)) %>% 
  slice_max(total)
```


# Extension

## Joins

---**Question 1**

Can you join all 4 datasets together so that you're left with a dataset that looks like below with **109 rows** and **12 columns**?

```{r}
card_base        
cust_base
fraud_base
transaction_base

card_base %>% 
  inner_join(cust_base, by = "cust_id") %>% 
  inner_join(transaction_base, by = c("card_number" = "credit_card_id")) %>% 
  inner_join(fraud_base, by = "transaction_id" )

```

## `tidyr`

---**Question 2**

Read in `exam_scores` and transform it into long format with two new columns `exam_question` and `score`. Then, using `separate` and `select`, remove superfluous information from the values in `exam_question`

```{r}
exam_scores <- read_csv("data/exam_scores.csv") 

exam_scores %>%
    pivot_longer(starts_with("exam"), 
               names_to = "exam_question", 
               values_to = "score") %>% 
  separate(exam_question, c("exam", "exam_question"), sep = "Q" ) %>% 
  select(-exam)
```
