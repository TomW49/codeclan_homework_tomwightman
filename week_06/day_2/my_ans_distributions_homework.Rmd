# 1 MVP

## Question 1.
Load the phones, clean_names() and explore it.
```{r}
library(prob)
library(tidyverse)
library(gtools)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
phones <- clean_names(read_csv("data/20190928-items.csv"))

glimpse(phones)
head(phones)
summary(phones)
phones %>% 
    summarise(across(.fns = ~ sum(is.na(.x))))
distinct(phones, brand)
```

## Question 2.
Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the phones set.
```{r}
# brand is samsung with 397
samsung_ratings <- phones %>% 
  group_by(brand) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  slice_max(count)
```


## Question 3.
For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?

```{r}
#  there is a negative skew as there are a number of 1 star ratings, generally 1 star ratings are due to faulty products
samsung_stats <- phones %>% 
  filter(brand == "Samsung") %>% 
  summarise(num = n(),
            mean = mean(rating),
            sd = sd(rating))

phones %>% 
  filter(brand == "Samsung") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), col = "white") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = samsung_stats$mean,
                            sd = samsung_stats$sd), colour = "red")
```

```{r}
# cc solutions
samsung_ratings <- phones %>%
  filter(brand == "Samsung") %>%
  select(rating)

samsung_stats <- phones %>%
  filter(brand == "Samsung") %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    mean = mean(rating),
    sd = sd(rating)
  )
samsung_stats

samsung_ratings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), col = "white") +
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm, 
    args = list(
      mean = samsung_stats$mean,
      sd = samsung_stats$sd
    ),
    col = "red"
  )
```

## Question 4.
We can be more quantitative in comparing the distribution of top brand ratings with a normal distribution. You calculated the mean() and sd() of your distribution in an earlier question. Use these values to calculate the proportions of ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean. Compare these proportions with those you expect for a normal distribution.
Hint
You can use a filter() to get only the ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean, and then think about how to calculate what proportion each of these filtered sets make of the total number of ratings. Youâ€™ll need to use three separate filter() and summarise() pipes to do this. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
samsung_ratings %>%
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_1sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))
```

```{r}
samsung_ratings %>%
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_1sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))

samsung_ratings %>%
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - 2 * samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + 2 * samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_2sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))

samsung_ratings %>%
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - 3 * samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + 3 * samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_3sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))
```
